# SpiseMisu.Minecraft

## Background

### How do we make code fun and more intuitive?

This year I became a volunteer at [Coding Pirates][codingpirates], a Danish
non-profit organization that tries to help kids to understand technology so they
can create and not just consume.

There are a few challenges that you are going to meet when you try to teach kids
to code. Mostly mathematical/logical concepts but also language based (English
keywords).

[Scratch][scratch], developed by `MIT`, seems to solve these issues but tends to
become boring in the long run. I use to say that coding in `Scratch` is a bit
like reading a "picture book".

We seem to face a challenge when we want to transition the children from reading
"picture books" to "read books", as many of the technologies used by us grown
ups, aren't that user-friendly as we think they are.

### Outcome

Therefore, I wanted to create something that was easy-to-use, but mainly `safe`
in the sense that it's very difficult to write some erroneous code, just like
[Scratch][scratch]:

```fsharp
#load "../SpiseMisu.Minecraft.fs"

open SpiseMisu
open SpiseMisu.MineCraft

module Safe =

  ...
  
  let story = minecraft {
    add frame
    add ceil
    add windows
  }
  
  let stories =
    fun n ->
      fun _ -> story
      |> List.init    n
      |> List.collect id (* flatten the list of lists *)
  
  let skyscraper = minecraft {
    (* origo facing +X (East) *)
    teleport
      Global 0 Global 4 Global 0
      East Horizon
    
    (* foundation *)
    fill
      Relative 50 Global 3 Relative  0
      Relative  0 Global 3 Relative 50
      Concrete LightGray
    
    (* stories *)
    add (stories 5)
  }
```

## Usage

You can clone the project or just download the `raw` version of
`SpiseMisu.Minecraft.fs` file from this project. Ideally you should set up a
dependency to this file, usually with a tool like `paket`:

* [Referencing a single file][paket]

## Examples

Please visit the `examples` folder in order to view a few scripts that uses this
library in order to get some information from a `Minecraft` server as well as
some that builds a skyscraper and colors it.


## Limitations

As it is right now, I have just added the `tp` (teleport) and the `fill`
`Minecraft` commands to the easy-to-write `DSL`. It should be possible though to
expand the `DSL` with all the other `Minecraft` commands without breaking
backward compatibility, as the `DSL` would just need to add new
`CustomOperation`s, only additive changes, and therefore complying with
`syntactic versioning`.

Also, it's not possible to access any `Minecraft` server as I have only
implemented login without authentication, see source function:
`loginUnauthenticated`. Therefore, this client will only connect to servers that
aren't running in `online-mode` (`online-mode=false` in `server.properties`).

Also in order to execute `Minecraft` commands, the users must be `OP` on the
server. That's very unlikely to be the default setting for `online-mode`
servers.

But at some point, I will give authentication a try with an implementation by
using something like: [The Legion of the Bouncy Castle][bouncycastle].

> Note: Also, compression is not implemented as well. Therefore, it must be
> disabled (`network-compression-threshold=-1` in `server.properties`) as well.

## Future work

I leave the road-map open as my only intention was to showcase how easy it is to
implement low-level protocols and abstract it to an easy to understand interface
while still being able to make something useful.

I'm hoping though, that some of the older `kids` from `Coding Pirates`, might
expand it with some cool stuff, instead of just using it as it is. Our motto:
`understand technology to create and not just consume`.

But, as a guy who spends must of his time in a `terminal`, I'm not going to
exclude implementing a fully functional `Minecraft` client that could be
executed from a `head-less` server.
